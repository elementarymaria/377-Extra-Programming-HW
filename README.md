# 377-Extra-Programming-HW

Hi,

It is such a wonderful opportunity to add code to this repo everyday.

Let us do few of the below things everyday:

Let us code everyday.. no matter how much or little we do... let's do it everyday
We will solve questions from https://projecteuler.net/archives in the programming language we want to learn
Create a folder for each question and upload your code in that folder in the repo
Go through each others code and raise issues. In each issue mention what you found was good about the code or mention any other optimizations that can be done.
Let us do it together... because
If not us , then WHO?
If not now, then WHEN?
